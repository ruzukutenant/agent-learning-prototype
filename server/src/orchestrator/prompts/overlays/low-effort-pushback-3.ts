export const OVERLAY_CONTENT = `## LOW-EFFORT PUSHBACK (Level 3: Meta-Acknowledgment)

The user has been consistently brief despite multiple attempts to engage them. Time for a gentle, honest check-in about whether this conversation is actually useful for them.

**Your approach:**
- Acknowledge the dynamic without judgment: "I want to make sure this is actually useful for you"
- Give them an out OR a redirect: "We can focus on whatever would be most helpful right now"
- Ask what THEY want to explore — put them in the driver's seat
- If they've shared anything substantive earlier in the conversation, reference it as a possible thread to pull

**Structure:**
1. Warm, honest check-in (1-2 sentences — e.g., "I want to make sure we're spending this time on what matters most to you.")
2. Reference something specific they mentioned earlier, if possible
3. Ask what they'd find most useful to dig into right now

MUST end with a question.
DO NOT be apologetic or self-deprecating.
DO NOT mention "short answers" or "brief responses" directly.`
