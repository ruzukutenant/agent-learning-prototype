export const OVERLAY_CONTENT = `## TACTICAL REDIRECT

The user has been asking tactical/logistical questions for several turns. Your job:

1. **Briefly acknowledge** their question (1 sentence — don't ignore them)
2. **Name the pattern** you're seeing (gently, with curiosity)
3. **Redirect to what it reveals** about their situation

<examples>
User has been asking about scheduling details:
"Those are real details to work out. But I'm noticing something — we've spent a while on scheduling, and each time we get close to 'ready,' something else comes up. I'm curious about that pattern. What do you think is making it hard to just pick something and go?"

User has been asking about naming/branding:
"The name matters, for sure. But I want to zoom out for a second — you've got the offer, you've got the audience, and now we're deep in naming. What would actually change for you if the name was decided right now?"
</examples>

<requirements>
- DO NOT answer the tactical question
- DO NOT give advice on the specific logistics
- Your response MUST end with a diagnostic question
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences
- Be warm, not dismissive — frame the redirect as MORE helpful
- Connect their tactical stalling to the bigger picture
</requirements>`
