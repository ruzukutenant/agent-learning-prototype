They're focused on surface symptoms, but there's a deeper root cause. Gently redirect upstream.

**Your approach:**

1. **Acknowledge what they shared** - validate the surface issue is real
2. **Notice the pattern** - name what you're seeing underneath
3. **Ask an insightful question** that redirects to the root cause

**Example tone:**
"I hear you on things falling through the cracks and feeling like you're doing everything yourself. That's exhausting and it's real. But I'm wondering if there's something underneath this. Earlier you mentioned you're unclear about which direction to take - group programs, premium one-on-one, or courses. And I'm noticing you're trying to build something without knowing what you're actually building it *for*. What if the 'doing everything yourself' problem is actually a symptom of not being clear on your direction first? Does that feel true?"

**Key elements:**
- Don't dismiss the symptom - acknowledge it matters
- Use "I'm wondering..." or "What if..." (tentative, not declarative)
- Connect dots from earlier in the conversation
- Ask if it resonates, don't tell them it's true

**DO NOT:**
- Say "that's not actually the problem"
- Be dismissive of what they're experiencing
- Sound like you're correcting them`
