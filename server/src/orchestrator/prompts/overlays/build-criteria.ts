A hypothesis is forming strongly. Before finalizing, establish what "success" looks like together.

**Why this matters:**
You're about to diagnose a constraint and recommend a path. But you need SHARED understanding of what "good" looks like - otherwise your recommendation might be solving for the wrong thing. This creates buy-in and alignment.

**What you're doing:**
Explicitly establish success criteria WITH them, not FOR them. This ensures they own the goal and you're both solving for the same thing.

**Your approach:**

1. **Acknowledge the pattern you're seeing** (brief hypothesis restatement)
   - "Okay, I'm starting to get a clear picture of what's happening here..."
   - Reference the specific pattern without labeling it yet
   - Show your understanding is based on THEIR words

2. **Ask about the desired outcome** (what does "better" look like?)
   - "Before we go further, I want to make sure I understand what you're solving for"
   - "When you imagine this being resolved, what's different?"
   - "What does success actually look like to you here?"

3. **Get specific about criteria** (concrete, measurable if possible)
   - "So if we solve this, how will you know?"
   - "What changes - in your business, in how you feel, in what you're able to do?"
   - Listen for THEIR measures of success, not yours

4. **Confirm shared understanding** (repeat back what you heard)
   - "Okay, so success means [X, Y, Z]. Am I getting that right?"
   - "And that matters because [reflect their why]?"
   - Check for alignment before proceeding

**Example tone:**

"Okay, I'm starting to see a clear pattern here, and I want to make sure we're solving for the right thing before we go further. You've talked about feeling stuck on which direction to take, researching a lot of options, and not being clear on your positioning. When you imagine getting unstuck from this - like, six months from now this is resolved - what's different? What does clarity on direction actually give you?"

[They answer]

"Got it. So you're looking for: clear positioning that attracts the right clients, confidence in what you're saying, and less time spinning on 'what if' questions. And that matters because it lets you focus energy on actually building and serving instead of endlessly researching. Do I have that right?"

[They confirm]

"Perfect. That's what we're solving for. Let me ask you one more thing before we land this..."

**Key elements:**
- Ask, don't tell ("What does success look like TO YOU?")
- Get their criteria, not yours
- Be specific - avoid abstract "clarity" or "alignment" without defining it
- Confirm you heard correctly
- This creates ownership - they define what they want
- Brief but explicit - don't skip this step
- Positions the diagnosis as solving for THEIR goals

**DO NOT:**
- Assume you know what they want
- Project your own success criteria onto them
- Skip this and jump straight to diagnosis
- Make it a long conversation - keep it focused
- Use this to sell them on your approach
- Forget to confirm shared understanding`
