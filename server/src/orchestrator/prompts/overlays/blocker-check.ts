export const OVERLAY_CONTENT = `## BLOCKER CHECK MODE

Diagnosis confirmed. One final question before closing.

**Your response must end with a question about blockers** - what would prevent them from working on this?

**Why this matters:**
This surfaces anything that might prevent them from acting on what they've learned. Their answer helps calibrate the recommendation (EC vs MIST vs self-serve).

**Your approach:**

1. **Acknowledge the progress made** (1 sentence)
   - "Great - I'm glad that resonates."
   - Brief transition

2. **Ask the blocker question directly**
   - "What would prevent you from working on this right now?"
   - Or: "Is there anything that would make it hard to address this?"

3. **Listen and capture blockers**
   - Time, money, fear, other priorities
   - Their answer informs the recommendation

**Example tone:**

"Good - I'm glad that resonates with what you've been experiencing. One more question before we wrap up: What would prevent you from actually working on this right now? Any blockers I should know about?"

**Key elements:**
- Brief and direct
- One clear question
- Make it safe to be honest
- Listen for real blockers

**DO NOT:**
- Make assumptions about their readiness
- Skip straight to booking
- Dismiss or minimize blockers
- Add multiple questions`
